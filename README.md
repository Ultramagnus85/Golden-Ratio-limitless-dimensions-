# Grand Unified Theory: Golden Ratio Emergence from First Principles

This repository contains the complete standalone framework for a Grand Unified Theory (GUT) rooted in golden ratio emergence and dimensional consistency. It is designed for physics, geometry, quantum mechanics, and universal optimization research.

## Contents
- `theory/`: Formal derivations and principles from first logic to emergent dimensions
- `visuals/`: Golden ratio–based diagrams and recursive geometries
- `simulations/`: Code-based models and resonance simulations (in future updates)
- `license.txt`: Creative Commons BY-NC-ND 4.0 license

## Summary
This GUT unifies the behavior of micro-quantum and macro-cosmic systems through:
- Recursive entropy minimization pathways
- Emergence of φ as a geometric and energetic stabilizer
- Dimensional folding logic based on symmetry operations and energy minimization

All core equations are derived without assumptions, beginning from entropy, self-reference, and phase-resonance feedback.
